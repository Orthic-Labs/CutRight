//! Temporal visual perception and reframing (REV2 plan §15.5 / Phase 7).
//!
//! The old `reframe_plan` sampled exactly one Vision face box at each
//! timeline segment's *midpoint* and used it, unmodified, as the crop center
//! for that whole segment. A subject who moves during the segment drifts out
//! of frame, nobody follows whoever is actually talking, on-screen text can
//! get cropped out, and a hard cut mid-segment (if the source itself has one)
//! gets no visual response at all.
//!
//! This module is the pure, deterministic core that replaces the single
//! midpoint box with a *temporal track*: many samples per segment, each
//! carrying evidence from up to five modalities (faces, active-speaker
//! evidence, body/hands, OCR boxes, saliency), explicit shot-boundary and
//! gap flags, and confidence — fused into one target per sample, then
//! smoothed with a bounded-acceleration integrator so the crop never snaps
//! or jitters, and finally nudged by a safe-zone cost function so on-screen
//! text is not cropped out where that's achievable within the same
//! acceleration bound.
//!
//! Everything in this module is pure (no I/O, no process spawns, no clock
//! reads) so it is exhaustively unit-testable: `reframe.rs` is the only
//! caller, and it owns sampling frames, invoking the Vision worker, loading
//! transcripts/manual anchors, and writing the resulting artifacts.
