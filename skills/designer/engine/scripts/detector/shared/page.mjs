// CR-V2-B1-008 PROVENANCE HEADER — CutRight v2 adaptation.
// Upstream: workspace-capabilities @ 6ee21f03a787e7b57dc412760a8996ea7a235302,
// tools/skills/designer/engine (see skills/designer/THIRD_PARTY.yml).
// This script is INERT PROVENANCE in the base CutRight runtime: it is never
// invoked as a bare shell command and performs no workspace mutation by itself.
// Execution happens only as the typed capability cutright://capability/designer.page
// inside the signed runtime pack, emitting AssetDelivery records (no direct mutation).
// See skills/designer/CUTRIGHT-ADAPTATION.md for the capability mapping.
